Day:

2. did it dirty - can optimize with modulo
3. `ord()` provides the integer of (Unicode) character 
5. `isalpha()` returns true if only characters [a-zA-Z]

8. Probably a much nicer/smarter way of doing this
10. Buggy on the left but works
12. Assumption that you can only go down by max 1 was erroneous
