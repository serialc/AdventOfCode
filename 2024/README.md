### Comments

Day:

1. Probably easier in R
2. Also easier in R, pulled out numpy
3. Regex fun - the new lines caused problems, twice
4. Letter salad - find the words
5. Ordering rules and fixing sequence orders.
6. Matrix routing - determine path
7. Math operations - recursion
8. Matrix distance repetition
9. Disc defragmentation - not very efficient solution
10. Von Neumann neighborhood elevation search
11. Ouch, took a long detour to reach memoization
12. P2 complexities are very problematic
16. Branching route finding
18. Path routing with area closing progressively
19. Memoization to the rescue. Matching values to longer string.
20. Maze solving and shortcuts
