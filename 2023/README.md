Day:

5. This was a 2D version of the 2021 day 22 challenge (which I stalled on).
6. Probably a simple formula to solve efficiently
7. Nitty gritty.
8. For part 2 needed to see that they would loop at different (but regular!) rates and take a long time to match. Had to determine individual counts and the figure out lowest common multiple (LCM).
9. Fine - difference pyramids.
